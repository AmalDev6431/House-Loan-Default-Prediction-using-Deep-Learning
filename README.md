# House-Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Description

This project involves creating a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default for future applicants based on historical data in the domain of finance. The dataset provided is highly imbalanced and includes various features, making this a challenging problem.

Objective

The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model that accurately predicts whether an applicant will be able to repay a loan or not, leveraging historical data from past loans.
Steps
1.	Data Loading:
  * Load the given dataset containing historical loan information.
    
2.	Data Preprocessing:
*	Check for null values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
3. Imbalanced Data Handling:
*	As the dataset is likely to be imbalanced, balance the data to avoid biases in the model's predictions.
4.	Data Visualization:
*	Plot the balanced or imbalanced data to understand the distribution of the target variable.
5.	Data Encoding:
*	Encode the necessary columns in preparation for model training.
6.	Model Building:
*	Utilize deep learning techniques to build a prediction model for loan default.
7.	Evaluation Metrics:
*	Calculate Sensitivity as a metric to evaluate the model's performance in identifying default cases correctly.
8.	Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC):
*	Compute the AUC-ROC metric, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between default and non-default instances.

Conclusion

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for loan default prediction based on historical data. By addressing data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and utilizing evaluation metrics, the goal is to create an accurate model that can assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
